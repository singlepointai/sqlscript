Catch-up contributions are permitted as per Section 5.01(d). Modifications can be made on a per-pay-period basis. Participants can also stop their contributions at any time. \n\nC - Automatic Enrollment: \n\tThe Plan includes Automatic Enrollment provisions to comply with the EACA. All employees without an existing election or with an election below the automatic enrollment amount are subject to these provisions. The initial automatic enrollment amount is 3% of pay, increasing by 1% annually until it reaches a maximum of 10%. The first deferral rate increase occurs on the first day of the second Plan Year following the initial enrollment, with subsequent increases on the first day of each Plan Year. Employees can withdraw contributions within 90 days after the first automatic deferral. Automatic contributions default to pre-tax. \n\nC - Safe Harbor Contributions: \n\tThis subsection outlines the plan's safe harbor contributions, confirming it is a safe harbor plan exempt from most testing, specifically satisfying ADP and ACP safe harbor rules. It includes no exclusions for safe harbor eligibility, and safe harbor conditions follow those for elective deferrals. Plan compensation for safe harbor contributions includes pay earned before participation. The safe harbor matching contribution formula consists of two rates: 100% match on the first 3% of compensation and 50% match on the next 2% (up to 5% total). Contributions are determined on a per pay period basis. \n\nC - Testing Elections: \n\tThe ADP Testing Elections (Section 5.02(a)) for the average deferral percentage of nonhighly compensated employees are based on the current year. Similarly, the ACP Testing Elections (Section 5.02(b)) for the average contribution percentage of nonhighly compensated employees are also determined using the current year. \n\n\n\nQUESTIONS: \nPlanFKMinMax:\n\tQuestion: 1.

Catch-up contributions are permitted as per Section 5.01(d). Modifications can be made on a per-pay-period basis. Participants can also stop their contributions at any time. \n\nC - Automatic Enrollment: \n\tThe Plan includes Automatic Enrollment provisions to comply with the EACA. All employees without an existing election or with an election below the automatic enrollment amount are subject to these provisions. The initial automatic enrollment amount is 3% of pay, increasing by 1% annually until it reaches a maximum of 10%. The first deferral rate increase occurs on the first day of the second Plan Year following the initial enrollment, with subsequent increases on the first day of each Plan Year. Employees can withdraw contributions within 90 days after the first automatic deferral. Automatic contributions default to pre-tax. \n\nC - Safe Harbor Contributions: \n\tThis subsection outlines the plan's safe harbor contributions, confirming it is a safe harbor plan exempt from most testing, specifically satisfying ADP and ACP safe harbor rules. It includes no exclusions for safe harbor eligibility, and safe harbor conditions follow those for elective deferrals. Plan compensation for safe harbor contributions includes pay earned before participation. The safe harbor matching contribution formula consists of two rates: 100% match on the first 3% of compensation and 50% match on the next 2% (up to 5% total). Contributions are determined on a per pay period basis. \n\nC - Testing Elections: \n\tThe ADP Testing Elections (Section 5.02(a)) for the average deferral percentage of nonhighly compensated employees are based on the current year. Similarly, the ACP Testing Elections (Section 5.02(b)) for the average contribution percentage of nonhighly compensated employees are also determined using the current year. \n\n\n\nQUESTIONS: \nADPACPPriorYear:\n\tQuestion: 19a.

If a participant's employment ends on the last day of the plan year, they are considered employed for allocation purposes. In case of coverage failures under Section 410(b), the employer must add enough participants to meet the required ratio. \n\nD - Employer Matching - Formula: \n\tThe employer matching contribution includes both participant catch-up contributions and Roth elective deferrals. The matching formula is a discretionary uniform percentage of the matched employee contributions. The employer's match is capped at 4% of the participant's compensation, with the match limited to the first 6% of compensation deferred. The determination of the matching contribution occurs at the end of the plan year. \n\nD - Non-Elective - Allocation Service: \n\tIn this subsection, an eligible employee receives non-elective contributions upon meeting specific criteria. To qualify, employees must complete at least 1,000 hours of service in a plan year and be employed on the last day of the plan year. The allocation service computation does not use hours equivalency. Exceptions are made for employees whose employment ends on the last day of the plan year. Coverage failures are addressed by adding participants to meet the required ratio. \n\nD - Non-Elective - Formula: \n\tThe Non-Elective Contributions are discretionary and determined by the Employer. These contributions are allocated to eligible participants who meet specific criteria outlined in Section B and D.14 to 17. The allocation follows a \"New Comparability - One Group per Participant\" formula, where each eligible participant forms a separate group. The Employer designates the contribution amount for each group, which does not need to be related to other groups' contributions. The Employer must notify the Plan Administrator or Trustee in writing of the contributions allocated to each group. The determination period for these contributions is at the end of the Plan Year. \n\nD - Other Contributions/415: \n\tRollovers: Rollover Contributions are permitted; all Eligible Employees may make a Rollover Contribution even if not yet a Participant.

If a participant's employment ends on the last day of the plan year, they are considered employed for allocation purposes. In case of coverage failures under Section 410(b), the employer must add enough participants to meet the required ratio. \n\nD - Employer Matching - Formula: \n\tThe employer matching contribution includes both participant catch-up contributions and Roth elective deferrals. The matching formula is a discretionary uniform percentage of the matched employee contributions. The employer's match is capped at 4% of the participant's compensation, with the match limited to the first 6% of compensation deferred. The determination of the matching contribution occurs at the end of the plan year. \n\nD - Non-Elective - Allocation Service: \n\tIn this subsection, an eligible employee receives non-elective contributions upon meeting specific criteria. To qualify, employees must complete at least 1,000 hours of service in a plan year and be employed on the last day of the plan year. The allocation service computation does not use hours equivalency. Exceptions are made for employees whose employment ends on the last day of the plan year. Coverage failures are addressed by adding participants to meet the required ratio. \n\nD - Non-Elective - Formula: \n\tThe Non-Elective Contributions are discretionary and determined by the Employer. These contributions are allocated to eligible participants who meet specific criteria outlined in Section B and D.14 to 17. The allocation follows a \"New Comparability - One Group per Participant\" formula, where each eligible participant forms a separate group. The Employer designates the contribution amount for each group, which does not need to be related to other groups' contributions. The Employer must notify the Plan Administrator or Trustee in writing of the contributions allocated to each group. The determination period for these contributions is at the end of the Plan Year. \n\nD - Other Contributions/415: \n\tRollovers: Rollover Contributions are permitted; all Eligible Employees may make a Rollover Contribution even if not yet a Participant.

If a participant's employment ends on the last day of the plan year, they are considered employed for allocation purposes. In case of coverage failures under Section 410(b), the employer must add enough participants to meet the required ratio. \n\nD - Employer Matching - Formula: \n\tThe employer matching contribution includes both participant catch-up contributions and Roth elective deferrals. The matching formula is a discretionary uniform percentage of the matched employee contributions. The employer's match is capped at 4% of the participant's compensation, with the match limited to the first 6% of compensation deferred. The determination of the matching contribution occurs at the end of the plan year. \n\nD - Non-Elective - Allocation Service: \n\tIn this subsection, an eligible employee receives non-elective contributions upon meeting specific criteria. To qualify, employees must complete at least 1,000 hours of service in a plan year and be employed on the last day of the plan year. The allocation service computation does not use hours equivalency. Exceptions are made for employees whose employment ends on the last day of the plan year. Coverage failures are addressed by adding participants to meet the required ratio. \n\nD - Non-Elective - Formula: \n\tThe Non-Elective Contributions are discretionary and determined by the Employer. These contributions are allocated to eligible participants who meet specific criteria outlined in Section B and D.14 to 17. The allocation follows a \"New Comparability - One Group per Participant\" formula, where each eligible participant forms a separate group. The Employer designates the contribution amount for each group, which does not need to be related to other groups' contributions. The Employer must notify the Plan Administrator or Trustee in writing of the contributions allocated to each group. The determination period for these contributions is at the end of the Plan Year. \n\nD - Other Contributions/415: \n\tRollovers: Rollover Contributions are permitted; all Eligible Employees may make a Rollover Contribution even if not yet a Participant.

The matching formula is a discretionary uniform percentage of the matched employee contributions. The employer's match is capped at 4% of the participant's compensation, with the match limited to the first 6% of compensation deferred. The determination of the matching contribution occurs at the end of the plan year. \n\nD - Non-Elective - Allocation Service: \n\tIn this subsection, an eligible employee receives non-elective contributions upon meeting specific criteria. To qualify, employees must complete at least 1,000 hours of service in a plan year and be employed on the last day of the plan year. The allocation service computation does not use hours equivalency. Exceptions are made for employees whose employment ends on the last day of the plan year. Coverage failures are addressed by adding participants to meet the required ratio. \n\nD - Non-Elective - Formula: \n\tThe Non-Elective Contributions are discretionary and determined by the Employer.
