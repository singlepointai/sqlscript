  "You are an expert in answering questions from a given 401(k) plan provision summary. Your role is to answer questions soley based on provided plan design summaries. The questions can either be selecting an option from the question or providing a value to fill in a blank.\n\n\nInstructions:\n        1. Answer Strictly Based on Context: Use only the given summary to answer the questions. Do not infer or assume information not explicitly stated in the summary.\n        2. Review the \"QUESTIONS\" section to understand each item, its possible values, and default value (if any).\n        3. For each item:\n           a. If the SUMMARY explicitly states a value that matches one of the possible values, use that value.\n           b. If the SUMMARY does not explicitly provide a value, but there is a default value in QUESTIONS, use the default.\n           c. If neither the SUMMARY nor the QUESTIONS provides a usable value, set the value to `null`.\n        4. Produce the final output as a valid JSON object containing each item and its determined value. Item key should exactly match from the QUESTIONS as it is used for further mappings.\n        5.

No need to format response as markdown.\n\nSUBSECTION: A - General Information\n\nSUMMARY: \nA - Plan Name/Effective Date: \n\tThe retirement plan, now titled 'Harrisburg Tennis Center Retirement Plan', was established on January 1, 2022. The plan year remains a consecutive 12-month period ending on December 31, aligning with the calendar year. The limitation year is consistent with the plan year. \n\nA - Plan Features: \n\tThe plan allows for elective deferrals and Roth elective deferrals but does not permit voluntary (after-tax) contributions. Employer matching contributions, non-elective contributions, and safe harbor contributions are all permitted under the plan. These features are outlined in sections 4.01 to 4.04 of the plan. \n\nA - Compensation: \n\tThe subsection defines \"Statutory Compensation\" to include W-2 compensation and post-severance compensation. For \"Plan Compensation\" purposes, allocations will be based on Statutory Compensation with exclusions limited to elective deferrals, employer match, and non-elective contributions. Exclusions include pay earned before participation and amounts contributed by the employer under specific tax code sections. Plan Compensation is determined over the Plan Year  \n\nA - Definitions: \n\tThe \"Disability\" definition outlines that a participant is considered disabled if they cannot perform any substantial gainful activity due to a physical or mental impairment expected to last at least 12 months or result in death, with medical evidence required to support the claim. The choice of law for this plan is governed by the state of Delaware. \n\n\n\nQUESTIONS: \nPlanNumber:\n\tQuestion: 1.

The plan year remains a consecutive 12-month period ending on December 31, aligning with the calendar year. The limitation year is consistent with the plan year. \n\nA - Plan Features: \n\tThe plan allows for elective deferrals and Roth elective deferrals but does not permit voluntary (after-tax) contributions. Employer matching contributions, non-elective contributions, and safe harbor contributions are all permitted under the plan. These features are outlined in sections 4.01 to 4.04 of the plan. \n\nA - Compensation: \n\tThe subsection defines \"Statutory Compensation\" to include W-2 compensation and post-severance compensation. For \"Plan Compensation\" purposes, allocations will be based on Statutory Compensation with exclusions limited to elective deferrals, employer match, and non-elective contributions. Exclusions include pay earned before participation and amounts contributed by the employer under specific tax code sections. Plan Compensation is determined over the Plan Year  \n\nA - Definitions: \n\tThe \"Disability\" definition outlines that a participant is considered disabled if they cannot perform any substantial gainful activity due to a physical or mental impairment expected to last at least 12 months or result in death, with medical evidence required to support the claim. The choice of law for this plan is governed by the state of Delaware. \n\n\n\nQUESTIONS: \nPlanNumber:\n\tQuestion: 1.

The plan year remains a consecutive 12-month period ending on December 31, aligning with the calendar year.

Employer matching contributions, non-elective contributions, and safe harbor contributions are all permitted under the plan. These features are outlined in sections 4.01 to 4.04 of the plan. \n\nA - Compensation: \n\tThe subsection defines \"Statutory Compensation\" to include W-2 compensation and post-severance compensation. For \"Plan Compensation\" purposes, allocations will be based on Statutory Compensation with exclusions limited to elective deferrals, employer match, and non-elective contributions.

Plan Compensation is determined over the Plan Year  \n\nA - Definitions: \n\tThe \"Disability\" definition outlines that a participant is considered disabled if they cannot perform any substantial gainful activity due to a physical or mental impairment expected to last at least 12 months or result in death, with medical evidence required to support the claim. The choice of law for this plan is governed by the state of Delaware. \n\n\n\nQUESTIONS: \nPlanNumber:\n\tQuestion: 1.
